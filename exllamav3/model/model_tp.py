        Create the tensor-parallel worker context.

        TP runs one Python process per participating CUDA device so each worker can own its CUDA context, loaded
        module shards and cache tensors independently. The selected output device is represented in the parent
        process by pseudo pipe/process objects, while the remaining devices are spawned with multiprocessing Pipes
        for command dispatch. A final CPU worker slot uses device -1 for backend helper work such as native
        CPU-based reductions. All workers receive the same backend description and shared-memory producer metadata,
        allowing large tensors and collectives to move through shared memory instead of being pickled over pipes.

        The output device is the TP "master" for this process: it runs synchronously in the main process through
        PseudoParentConn instead of in a spawned worker. _load_tp() keeps that device last in active_devices so
        fan-out dispatch reaches spawned workers before invoking the blocking pseudo-worker path.
