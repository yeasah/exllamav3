        Initialize generator

        :param model:
            The model (loaded)

        :param cache:
            Paged cache

        :param tokenizer:
            Tokenizer

        :param max_batch_size:
            The maximum number of sequences to process in parallel. The generator will also limit this
            dynamically considering the available cache space.

        :param max_chunk_size:
            Maximum number of tokens to process in parallel during prefill (prompt ingestion). Should not
            exceed the model's max_input_len but can be lowered to trade off prompt speed for a shorter
            interruption to ongoing jobs when a new job is started.

        :param max_q_size:
            Maximum number of tokens to evaluate per sequence during generation. Leave this at the default
            (8) unless there's a good reason to increase it.

        :param draft_model:
            Draft model. Enables speculative decoding with draft, and must be specified along with
            draft_cache. Note that speculative decoding with many parallel jobs is likely not advantageous.

        :param draft_cache:
            Cache allocated for draft model. Must be same size as main cache.

        :param num_draft_tokens:
            Number of future tokens to draft. Default is 4 unless the draft model has a preference (e.g.
            from DFlash block size)

        :param ngram_match_min:
            Minimum number of tokens to match for n-gram draft (0 = disabled).

        :param dynamic_draft_tokens:
            Adapt the per-round draft length to the workload. The draft is cut using drafter confidence
            (argmax logit), calibrated online against observed acceptance rates (see draft_confidence). A
            DFlash drafter still runs at its fixed diffusion block size and only the verified window shrinks;
            AR and MTP drafters stop the drafting loop itself early, saving one drafter forward per pruned
            position. The acceptance behavior of the surviving positions is unchanged. Has no effect on n-gram
            drafting, whose draft length already adapts through the match length.

        :param draft_confidence:
            Used with dynamic_draft_tokens and a draft model: target acceptance probability for drafted
            positions, evaluated against an online mapping from drafter confidence (argmax logit) to observed
            acceptance rates. Scale-free and portable across model pairs. For DFlash (block produced at fixed
            cost) the block is cut at the first position whose estimated conditional acceptance drops below
            the target. For AR and MTP drafters (one forward per position, and a position only pays off if
            everything before it is accepted too) drafting stops when the running product of conditional
            estimates - the probability that the next position actually contributes a token - falls below the
            target. Lower values keep longer drafts; higher values truncate more aggressively. Ignored for
            n-gram drafting.

        :param record_draft_stats:
            Append (position, window, accepted) per verification round to job.draft_stats, for analysis.

        :param show_visualizer:
            Open window to render visualization of cache (for debug/demonstration purposes)

        :param enable_defrag:
            Defragment cache periodically

        :param cpu_cache_size:
            Size in bytes of a second-tier page cache in pinned system memory, 0 (default) to disable. Complete
            K/V pages evicted from the GPU cache are stored there and restored on prompt-cache hits instead of
            being recomputed by prefill. Not currently supported in tensor-parallel mode

        :param recurrent_cache_size:
            Size of recurrent cache, in bytes. Recurrent cache resides in system RAM. Default is 4 GB.
            Ignored if model doesn't use recurrent states

        :param recurrent_checkpoint_interval:
            Minimum number of tokens between recurrent checkpoints in model output and the tail end of
            the prompt. Must be a multiple of the page size. Model architecture determines default

        :param recurrent_checkpoint_interval_pp]:
            Minimum number of tokens between recurrent checkpoints during prompt ingestion. Must be a
            multiple of the page size. Default is 32768 tokens

        This is a utility function for easily generating one or more completions from one or more prompt strings. For
        more versatility and streaming functionality, use the async wrapper or create Job objects directly, enqueue()
        them and call iterate() to receive one token at a time

        :param prompt:
            If this argument is a list, its length determines the batch size, and the output will be a list of strings
            as well. Each prompt is either a string or a pair of prompts for CFG sampling. If CFG is used, sampler
            settings must contain cfg_scale.

        :param sampler:
            Sampler stack settings for all prompts in batch or list of samplers for each prompt.

        :param max_new_tokens:
            Max number of tokens to generate.

        :param min_new_tokens:
            Minimum number of tokens to generate before stop tokens become active. Until this number have been
            sampled, stop tokens are suppressed but stop strings will still end response.

        :param seed:
            Seed for the sampling RNG. Doesn't guarantee perfect determinism from the implementation.

        :param token_healing:
            Apply token healing by regenerating the last token of the input sequence with prefix
            constraint.

        :param encode_special_tokens:
            Encode special tokens (BOS etc.) represented as text in the input. If False, special tokens are
            interpreted as text by the tokenizer.

        :param decode_special_tokens:
            Decode special tokens output by the model. If False, tokens marked as special in the tokenizer
            are decoded as empty strings.

        :param stop_conditions:
            List of strings and/or token IDs that will end generation. The stop condition is not included
            in the output.

        :param add_bos:
            Prepend the tokenizer's specified BOS token to the input.

        :param abort_event:
            Forwarded to the model during generation. Will abort prefill/context ingestion if triggered.

        :param completion_only:
            Only return completion. If False, returned string will include the input prompt.

        :param filters:
            (List of) list of Filters to apply during generation. Each prompt in a batch needs
            its own filter list, or a value of None to disable filters for individual prompts.

        :param return_last_results:
            If True, returns the last results dict for each job

        :param embeddings:
            Optional list of MMEmbeddings to use for, or list of lists for batched generation

        :param max_rq_tokens:
            Maximum number of tokens before job is requeued. Rounded to nearest page boundary. This limits how
            many new pages are allocated in the cache for the job in any one round and allows a single job to use
            the full cache size without limiting concurrency for other jobs.

        :param stop_on_loop:
            Tuple of (window_size: int, min_reps: int), or None. If enabled, generation will end if the last
            window_size tokens sampled make up >= min_reps consecutive instances of a looping string.
