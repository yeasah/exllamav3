// Persistent-worker handoff for CPU-offloaded MoE experts (pattern follows the native TP
// backend's CPU-assisted all-reduce: pinned shared-memory flags, GPU-side publish/wait kernels,
// a spin-parked child process consuming a job ring).
//
// Shared-memory layout (allocated and cudaHostRegistered by the parent, plain-mapped by the
// child; all offsets in bytes from the region base):
//
//   [ctrl block]
//     u32 quit          @ 0    parent -> child: exit the worker loop
//     u32 pass_wake     @ 64   parent bumps at the start of every forward pass: child spins hard
//     u32 abort         @ 128  set by the GPU wait kernel on timeout; parent checks per pass
//     u32 ready         @ 192  child -> parent: worker loop entered, layers loaded
//     u32 jobs_tail     @ 256  parent producer index (job ring)
//     u32 jobs_head     @ 320  child consumer index
//     MoeJob ring       @ 384  MOE_JOB_RING entries
//     u32 data_ready[]  @ SLOT_FLAGS_OFFSET       per slot, stride 64: GPU publishes job seq
//     u32 done[]        @ SLOT_FLAGS_OFFSET + 64*MOE_MAX_SLOTS, stride 64: child publishes seq
//     u32 consumed[]    @ SLOT_FLAGS_OFFSET + 2*64*MOE_MAX_SLOTS, stride 64: the collecting
//                         device's stream publishes seq after reading the slot output back.
//                         Slot reuse waits on this, not done: with offloaded layers spread
//                         over multiple GPUs, the next tenant's issue runs on a different
//                         stream than the previous tenant's readback, and done (child
//                         finished writing) alone lets the child overwrite the output while
//                         the readback is still queued on the other device
//   [slot data]         @ MOE_CTRL_SIZE, num_slots x slot_size
//     per slot: [x fp16 cap_rows*Hi][sel i32 cap_rows*topk][w fp16 cap_rows*topk]
//               [out fp32 cap_rows*Ho], each section 64-byte aligned
//
// Ordering: the parent writes a job descriptor and bumps jobs_tail before enqueueing the GPU
// memcpys and the data_ready publish for that seq, so the child always sees the descriptor
// before it can see the data flag. Sequence numbers increase monotonically from 1; slot reuse is
// safe because the GPU stream serializes on the wait kernel of the oldest outstanding job.
