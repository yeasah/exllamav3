    Quantize a group of same-K linears together, batching the scale search and the LDLQ recursion so the
    quantize_tiles kernel sees large batches instead of one small tensor's worth of tiles per step.

    Two layouts, chosen by whether the H_data dicts are the same object:
      - shared Hessian (e.g. all gate/up projections of a block-sparse MLP, or fused q/k/v): the regularized
        weights are concatenated along out_features and run through a single ldlq() pass with the shared L.
        This is exact: LDLQ treats columns independently given L, and su (drawn per qmap) is identical
      - distinct Hessians over same-shape tensors (e.g. per-expert down projections): weights are stacked and
        run through ldlq_batched() with per-tensor L

    RNG is re-seeded per tensor (finalize's su draw on first call for the qmap, then the per-tensor sv draw),
    so per-tensor results should match quantize_exl3() in the wider matmuls. Tensors whose Hessian fails to
    finalize (q_fallback) are routed through quantize_exl3() individually.
