# Environment variables

Runtime and build-time toggles recognized by ExLlamaV3. All of these have sensible defaults;
they exist mainly for A/B testing, debugging and working around platform quirks.

Boolean-ish variables treat `0` as off and any other value as on unless noted. C++-side
variables are read once (on first use) and cached; Python-side variables are read at import
time. Either way, set them before loading a model.

## Attention

### `EXL3_BC_ATTN` (default: `1`)

Graph-captured C++ decode attention. For decode steps (bsz ≤ 8, q_len ≤ 16) the whole attention
block -- q/k/v projections, fused head norm + RoPE, cache append, flash-decoding attention and
o_proj -- runs as a single C++ call, captured as one CUDA graph per (bsz, q_len) shape and
replayed with only the input/output/position/block-table pointers patched. Removes effectively
all Python host time from the attention block; the largest gains are on host-bound setups
(small or hybrid models, fast GPUs, contended CPUs). The same flag covers the equivalent path
for MLA layers (BC_MLAttention: q projections, latent projection and staging, partial RoPE,
W_UK absorption, cache append, absorbed flash-decoding, W_UV unfold and o_proj as one graph).

Module or cache configurations the path does not support (TP, headwise gates, LayerNorm or
span-heads head norms, non-EXL3 projections, compander-enabled quant cache, ...) fall back to
the regular dispatch path by design. Unexpected errors while building the path are raised, not
swallowed. Set to `0` to disable the path entirely.

### `EXL3_BC_ATTN_TRACE` (default: `0`)

Print one line per attention module/cache-layer pair when the graph-captured decode path is
built or declined (module key, device). Activation check for A/B tests: a benchmark comparing
`EXL3_BC_ATTN` settings is only meaningful if the enabled run actually built the path.

### `EXL3_BC_DSA` (default: `1`)

DeepSeek-V4 counterpart of `EXL3_BC_ATTN`: for decode steps (bsz 1, q_len ≤ 16) the whole DSA
attention step runs as one graph-captured C++ call: the batched x-side projection fan, fused
head-norm RoPE, both compressor updates (compressed/indexer entry pools and rings), the
lightning-indexer scoring and capture-safe top-k selection (long-context regime), the
flash-decoding sparse attention with fused output de-rotation, the grouped o_proj and the
sliding-window ring append. One graph per (cache layer, job slot, q_len, dense/top-k regime);
position flows through shared device scalars (one 8-byte host write per step per job) plus a
handful of patched scalar node parameters (live pool width, causal bounds), so replays never
rebuild anything. Steps that need a host-side window ring shift or rebase (page-granular, rare)
decline to the eager path for that step, as do ineligible layer configurations (non-EXL3
projections, ...) permanently. Set to `0` to force the eager path everywhere.

### `EXL3_BC_DSA_DEBUG` (default: `0`)

Raise errors encountered while building the graphed DSA path instead of silently declining to
the eager path. Diagnostic for why a configuration falls back.

### `EXL3_DSV4_NO_XFAN` (default: `0`)

Set to disable the eager DSA path's projection fans. With the fans, the x-side projections that
share the block input (q_a, wkv, and the compressor/indexer kv/gate pairs) run as a single
per-matrix-N batched MGEMM, and q_b pairs with the indexer query projection over q_res the same
way in the top-k regime: six to eight GEMV launches collapse into two. A/B switch for the
eager path only; the graphed path (`EXL3_BC_DSA`) builds its own fan and is not affected.
Layers whose projections mix quantization formats or bitrates decline the fan by themselves.

### `EXL3_QC_STAGING` (default: `1`)

How quantized K/V caches feed the attention kernels (replaces the former `EXL3_QC_ATTN`). Only
affects quantized caches.

- `0` - no staging: packed cache tensors feed the prefill and decode kernels directly, with
  dequantization fused into the kernel loads. Lowest memory: no staging scratch is ever
  allocated, and nothing extra is reserved during autosplit loading. Prefill pays for the
  in-kernel expansion (roughly 5–25% on the attention kernel depending on bitrate and GPU),
  which every kv tile repeats once per query block and sibling query head.
- `1` - prefill staging (default): prefill chunks of 256+ tokens dequantize the referenced
  cache window once into a shared fp16 scratch and run the fp16 kernel over it, putting
  quantized-cache prefill within ~1–3% of fp16. Decode stays on the direct path. The scratch is
  sized for the full cache at batch size 1 (`2 * max_num_tokens * num_kv_heads * head_dim`
  fp16 elements, shared across layers per device) and is allocated by the autosplit measuring
  pass, so the space is reserved at load time rather than discovered at the first long prefill.
  For very large caches this reservation is the tradeoff to weigh against `0` (e.g. ~4 GB at
  1M tokens with 8 kv heads of dim 128).
- `2` - full staging: legacy dequantize-then-attend path; whole cache layers are expanded into
  full-size fp16 temporaries before attention. Debug/A-B mode (same effect as the former
  `EXL3_QC_ATTN=0`); only affects decode if `EXL3_BC_ATTN` is also disabled, since the graphed
  decode path reads the packed cache directly.

### `EXL3_QC_PF_TWO_PASS_MIN_Q` (default: `256`)

Query-length threshold for the prefill staging pass at `EXL3_QC_STAGING=1`. Chunks shorter than
this keep the direct path, which reads less global memory (relevant for short trailing chunks
over long contexts at low cache bitrates). Tuning/testing knob.

### `EXL3_QC_PREFILL_NS` (default: `0` = measure)

Pipeline stage count for the direct quantized-cache prefill kernel. Unset/`0`, the best of
{1, 2} is measured once per (shape family, device) at first use; a nonzero value pins it,
skipping the measurement. Only relevant where the direct path still runs (`EXL3_QC_STAGING=0`,
or short chunks below the threshold above).

### `EXL3_MLA_PREFILL` (default: `mha`)

Prefill strategy for MLA layers: `mha` up-projects past latent tiles from the compressed cache
and attends in MHA form (~2.8× fewer FLOPs per query-past pair); `absorbed` restores the
single-kernel absorbed-form prefill for A/B testing.

### `EXL3_PREFER_FA2` (default: `0`)

Put the flash-attn-2 backends ahead of the built-in Triton attention kernels in the dispatch
order. flash-attn is an optional dependency; when it is not installed, this switch is ignored
(with a warning) and the built-in kernels serve everything. The Triton kernels match or beat
FA2 across supported hardware and cover more cases (quantized caches, head dims > 256,
attention sinks); this switch exists for A/B comparison.

## EXL3 GEMM / GEMV

### `EXL3_GEMV` (default: `1`)

QTIP-style small-m fp16 GEMV path, dispatched from the main GEMM entry point when the shape
heuristic applies. `0` disables, `1` uses the measured heuristic envelope (default), `2` forces
the path wherever its hard constraints allow (testing).

### `EXL3_GEMV_SMEM` (default: `-1`)

Weight-extraction strategy inside the fp16 GEMV kernel: `-1` picks per bitrate (default), `0`
forces shuffle extraction, `1` forces shared-memory staging. Testing only.

### `EXL3_INT8_GEMV` (default: `2`)

Fused int8-activation GEMV for tensors quantized with the mul1 codebook: one cooperative launch
covering the input Hadamard, activation quantization, dp4a GEMV and output Hadamard. `2`
(default) is the plain int8 mode, `1` the error-feedback residual mode (~15–16 bit effective
activation precision, slightly slower), `0` disables the path.

Tensors quantized with other codebooks are unaffected and keep their regular kernels. When the
mode is enabled, gate/up (and other same-input) tensor pairs that the int8 path can take are
also *unfused* from the batched MGEMM when each matrix is wide enough to fill the GPU on its
own. See the two thresholds below. The graphed decode paths (BC modules) handle both the fused
and unfused configurations.

### `EXL3_INT8_GEMV_MAX_K` (default: per-arch)

Highest bitrate K the int8 GEMV path accepts; above it the regular fp16 kernel runs instead.
The default is 6 on Hopper and Blackwell and 5 elsewhere: Ampere is DRAM-bound from K = 6 up,
where the int8 path's reduced per-weight compute no longer helps (and Ada is marginal there),
but on Hopper the fp16 kernel is throughput-bound at K = 6 as well. Values up to 8 can be forced
to test the crossover on unmeasured parts; the MGEMM unfusing threshold below follows this cap
automatically.

### `EXL3_MGEMM_K_THRESHOLD` (default: per-arch), `EXL3_MGEMM_N_THRESHOLD` (default: `8192`)

Unfusing heuristics applied when the int8 GEMV mode is enabled, to mul1 tensor pairs only: keep
the fused MGEMM when the bitrate K is at or above the K threshold (the int8 path declines those
anyway), or when the matrices are narrower than the N threshold (too narrow for separate GEMV
calls to fill the GPU; batching is what restores utilization there). The K threshold defaults
to one above the int8 path's per-arch K cap (see `EXL3_INT8_GEMV_MAX_K`); setting it explicitly
pins it on every device.

### `EXL3_NO_FUSED_RECONSTRUCT` (default: `0`)

Set to disable original-basis weight reconstruction on the hgemm prefill path. Long inputs to
EXL3 linears run reconstruct-then-GEMM; by default the reconstruct kernel emits the weights in
the original basis. Both 128-point Hadamard transforms and the sign vectors are folded into
the (memory-bound) reconstruct kernel's shared-memory epilogue, so the GEMM runs on the raw
input and the standalone input/output Hadamard launches disappear (previously ~14% of
long-chunk prefill GPU time; ~+6-7% prefill throughput on DeepSeek-V4-Flash). The fused kernel
does k·n-proportional extra work while the saved Hadamard traffic scales with rows·(k+n), so it
engages at 1024+ input rows (breakeven is ~400–900 depending on shape); below that, and for the
per-expert MoE dequant path (small row counts per expert), the rotated-basis pipeline
(input Hadamard → GEMM → output Hadamard) is kept. Set to `1` to force the rotated-basis
pipeline everywhere, for A/B testing.

### `EXLLAMAV3_TUNE_CACHE` (default: platform cache dir)

Override the path of the on-disk autotune cache for the cooperative GEMM kernels (kernel shape
selection results, persisted across runs).

## Sampling

### `EXL3_FUSED_SAMPLER` (default: `1`)

Collapse eligible sampler stacks into fused kernels at sampler construction. Stacks ending in
greedy or temperature/min-P/top-K/top-P/Gumbel steps (in the orders emitted by the preset
samplers, optionally preceded by repetition/presence/frequency penalties) run as a few custom
kernels working directly in logit space, instead of the step-by-step softmax/sort pipeline.
Collapsed temperature/min-P stacks sample the same token as the uncollapsed reference for the
same seed, up to float rounding at exact ties; top-K/top-P stacks keep the same token set as
the sort-based reference (ties at the exact cutoff are all kept) but draw their Gumbel noise by
token id rather than sorted position, so individual seeds map to different samples from the
same distribution. Stacks the collapse does not recognize fall back to the step-by-step path by
design. Set to `0` to disable collapsing entirely, e.g. for A/B validation against the
reference implementation.

## CPU MoE offload

Experimental: `-mcl`/`--moe_cpu_offload` (main model) and `-dmcl`/`--draft_moe_cpu_layers`
(draft model or MTP head) run the routed experts of the first N block-sparse MoE layers on the
CPU, expert weights resident in system RAM, freeing the VRAM those layers' experts would have
used. Layer-split mode only; requires mul1-codebook experts, K ≤ 8, and uniform per-expert
biases (all or none; ineligible layers fall back to the GPU as usual). A spawned worker process
per model component (main / draft / MTP) owns its own expert weights and a job ring in pinned
shared memory; the parent's forward pass never blocks on the CPU. During prefill, hot experts
additionally stream their weights to the GPU and run there (via the fused kernel or per-expert
dequant, by size) while the CPU works the remaining tail. See `-mclt`/`-dmclt` below for 
thread configuration, and the knobs below for tuning the split.

These knobs are collected in `exllamav3/model/moe_cpu_host.py`'s `MoeCpuTuning` class (read once
from the environment at import); for a same-process sweep, mutate fields on the module-level
`TUNING` singleton before constructing a model instead of setting env vars.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_OFFLOAD` (default: `0`)

Fallback value for when `-mcl` is not set.

### `-mclt` / `--moe_cpu_threads`, `-dmclt` / `--draft_moe_cpu_threads` (CLI, not env)

Worker thread count, set per component via `config.infer_params.moe_cpu_threads` /
`draft_moe_cpu_threads`. Takes precedence over `EXL3_MOE_CPU_THREADS` below when set.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_THREADS` (default: `cpu_count // 2`)

Fallback worker thread count when the component's `-mclt`/`-dmclt` config value is not set.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_SLOTS` (default: `4`), `EXL3_MOE_CPU_SLOT_ROWS` (default: `64`)

Compute job-ring depth and rows per slot (the CPU-tail chunk size). Each slot holds one
in-flight chunk of the D2H-staged input, selected experts and routing weights, and the
H2D-staged fp32 output.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_WSLOTS` (default: `2`), `EXL3_MOE_CPU_WSLOT_MB` (default: `32`)

Depth and per-slot size of the pinned/VRAM weight-staging ring used by GPU-streamed prefill.
Each slot must be large enough to hold a batch of streamed experts' packed weights (see
`EXL3_MOE_STREAM_BATCH_EXPERTS`); if not, the batch is capped by capacity instead.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_STAGE_THREADS` (default: `4`)

Memcpy threads used by the worker's dedicated stager (which packs streamed experts' weights
into the pinned staging ring, concurrently with the compute pool working the CPU tail). A few
threads saturate host memcpy bandwidth; raising this mainly helps wide streamed batches on
models with many small experts (see issue trace on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B).

### `EXL3_MOE_STREAM_T` (default: per-device, bandwidth-scaled from `16`)

Minimum per-expert token-assignment count (in a prefill chunk) for an expert's weights to be
streamed to the GPU instead of computed on the CPU tail. Unset, the effective threshold scales
inversely with the measured pinned→device bandwidth (probed once per device): a chipset-attached
x4 link needs a much hotter expert to justify the weight DMA than a CPU-direct x16 one. Setting
this explicitly pins the threshold on every device and disables the bandwidth scaling.

### `EXL3_MOE_STREAM_FUSED_T` (default: `512`)

Maximum per-expert assignment count eligible for the fused `exl3_moe` GPU kernel (one launch
covers a whole batch of experts); above this an expert still streams but runs through the
per-expert reconstruct path instead. Same eligibility as the GPU-resident fused path otherwise
(mul1, silu/gelu gated or relu2 gateless, no per-expert biases, no padded dims); ineligible
layers use the reconstruct path for every streamed expert regardless of count.

### `EXL3_MOE_STREAM_MIN_ROWS` (default: `32`)

Prefill chunk size floor below which GPU streaming never engages and every expert runs on the
CPU tail as usual (decode, at 1 row per pass, always stays under this).

### `EXL3_MOE_STREAM_BATCH_EXPERTS` (default: `24`, max `256`)

Experts packed per weight-staging batch (one stage job, one DMA, and, below
`EXL3_MOE_STREAM_FUSED_T, one fused-kernel launch). Further capped by staging-slot capacity
(`EXL3_MOE_CPU_WSLOT_MB` divided by one expert's packed byte size). The hard ceiling of 256 is
the structural size of the job descriptor's expert-id array; raising the ceiling itself costs
only a small amount of shared-memory overprovisioning, not runtime.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_MAX_ISA` (default: unset, auto-detect)

Caps the CPU kernel's runtime ISA detection at `scalar`, `avx2`, `bw`/`avx512bw`,
`vnni`/`avx512`, or `vbmi`, for testing a lower-tier kernel path on hardware that supports
better. The `bw` tier covers AVX-512F/BW/VL hardware without VNNI (Skylake-SP/X: 1st-gen Xeon
Scalable, Core-X), which previously fell through to `avx2`: the `vnni` dword kernel with the
AVX2 tier's vpmaddubsw/vpmaddwd accumulate, ~1.5x the `avx2` tier's cold-expert decode
throughput on a Xeon Gold 6148. The `vbmi` tier
(AVX512-VBMI byte-gather state extraction, Zen 4+ / Ice Lake+; Cascade/Cooper Lake have VNNI
without VBMI and stay on the `vnni` tier) is 15-70% faster than the dword scheme depending on
bitrate. Never upgrades past what the CPU actually supports; unrecognized values are ignored.
Read once per process (parent and worker independently), so it must be set before either is
started. Note that capping below `bw` also disables the swizzled weight layout (see
`EXL3_MOE_CPU_SWIZZLE`).

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_SWIZZLE` (default: `1`)

Repack the CPU worker's expert trellis copies into a band-contiguous ("swizzled") layout at
load, so each GEMV band streams sequentially from DRAM instead of in short strided runs
(+45-75% cold decode GEMV throughput measured on a 7960X, reaching the sequential-read
roofline). Takes effect on every AVX-512 kernel tier: `vbmi`, whose byte-gather extraction
leaves the register headroom for the wide bands the swizzled layout wants at m > 1, `bw`
(+2-29% on Skylake-SP, where the sequential per-band k-stream beats 96-128 B strided reads)
and `vnni` (the dword kernel with the same band structure; +40% cold-expert decode measured
with the tier forced on a 7960X). The `avx2` and `scalar` tiers read the native layout. K8
tensors always stay in the native layout (they route to the dword kernel). The GPU-streaming
prefill path un-swizzles during staging, so staged bytes reaching the GPU dequant are
unaffected. Set to `0` to keep the native layout.

### `EXL3_MOE_MEMOPS` (default: `1`)

The parent enqueues its wait/publish handshake with the worker as CUDA stream memory operations
(`cuStreamWaitValue32`/`WriteValue32`, front-end executed: no SM occupancy, no per-op launch
cost) rather than the older spin-wait kernels. Set to `0` to force the kernel fallback, kept
around specifically because the memop path is not yet exercised on Windows. The kernel path's
30-second stall timeout does not apply to the memop path; a dead worker there is instead detected
by a host-side watchdog that unblocks any pending wait.

### `EXL3_MOE_STREAM_DEBUG` (default: `0`)

Print per-layer and per-batch engagement: streamed bandwidth probe result and threshold, expert
counts, streamed-vs-tail assignment split, and fused-vs-reconstruct tier split within each
streamed batch.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_PROF` (default: `0`)

Accumulate per-phase wall time in the CPU compute pool and report every 512 jobs. Enabled once
per worker at startup.

### `EXL3_MOE_ARENA_DEBUG` (default: `0`)

Print each hugepage-arena chunk allocation (size, running total) as the CPU worker loads expert
weights, and confirmation when the end-of-load `MADV_COLLAPSE` pass (see
`EXL3_MOE_ARENA_HUGEPAGE`) is issued. The worker copies loaded expert tensors into a small
number of large (1 GiB) anonymous mappings instead of leaving them as many separate small
(sub-2MB) allocations, confirmed via `/proc/<pid>/smaps` that the latter cannot be backed by
transparent huge pages even under system-wide THP=always, since each is its own VMA.

### `EXL3_MOE_ARENA_HUGEPAGE` (default: `1`)

Whether to attempt hugepage promotion for the arena chunks described above. This is done as a
single `MADV_COLLAPSE` (Linux 6.1+) pass over each chunk *after* all expert weights for every
offloaded layer have been loaded, deliberately not via a live `MADV_HUGEPAGE` hint during the
per-layer writes: on hosts where `/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag` is `madvise`, that
hint makes the kernel do *synchronous* compaction on first touch of a hinted region once
easily-compactable free memory runs low, which turns into multi-second stalls per offloaded
layer partway through a large model's load. The collapse pass runs on a background thread in
the worker after it has started serving: it copies the whole arena (about 4 GiB/s on a
7960X when the chunks were faulted as 4K pages, i.e. on `transparent_hugepage/enabled =
madvise` hosts, plus any compaction the kernel needs first), so it must not sit on the
startup path; the worker reads 4K pages until each chunk lands. `EXL3_MOE_ARENA_DEBUG=1`
prints how long it took. Set to `0` to skip hugepage promotion entirely.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_START_TIMEOUT` (default: `60`)

Seconds the parent waits for the CPU worker to signal ready after every offloaded layer has
been handed over. Startup is the shared-memory attach, layer registration and thread spawn,
so the default is only a safety net against a wedged worker; raise it on very slow hosts.

### `EXL3_MOE_CPU_PIN` (default: `1`)

Pin each worker thread (and the worker's own main thread) to a distinct physical CPU core,
SMT siblings last, instead of leaving placement to the OS scheduler. On an SMT host, unpinned
placement is a real source of run-to-run throughput variance, two workers can land on the same
physical core (contending for its execution resources) on one run and not the next; measured on
a 24-core/48-thread SMT2 box, this swung matrix-decode throughput 61–105 GB/s run to run,
pinned flat at ~105 GB/s (88% of the box's measured 24-thread DRAM read bandwidth). Set to `0`
to disable, e.g. on a shared/multi-tenant host where fixed placement may fight the scheduler's
own balancing across other processes. Falls back to no pinning if the CPU topology can't be
read.

### `EXL3_MOE_HANDOFF_PROF` (default: unset)

Enable GPU/CPU handoff profiling, for debug purposes. 

## Model loading

### `EXL3_EXPANDABLE_SEGMENTS` (default: `1`)

Use expandable segments for all Torch allocations. Opt out with a value of 1 or by explicitly
setting `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF`.

### `EXL3_LOAD_ARENA` (default: `1`)

Slab allocation for small weight tensors during (deferred) module loads: tensors up to 16 MB
are carved out of shared 128 MB per-device blocks (first-fit over the open blocks, so partially
filled tails are packed by later small tensors) instead of getting one CUDA caching-allocator
allocation each. MoE models with many small per-expert tensors otherwise shatter the allocator
into tens of thousands of segments with large reserved-but-unallocated overhead. Unloading a
module frees its blocks; at most one boundary block shared with a neighboring module stays
pinned. Set to `0` to fall back to per-tensor allocations.

### `EXL3_NGRAM_STREAM` (default: `1`)

Default for `Config.infer_params.ngram_stream_from_disk`: stream an n-gram embedding table
(PLE models, e.g. Qwen3.8-Flash-Next) from disk with per-forward row gathers (run-coalesced
positioned reads into pinned staging — threaded preads on Linux, overlapped `ReadFile` at high
queue depth on Windows) instead of loading the whole table into system RAM. The quantized table
is tens of GB, and streaming costs little on SSD-class storage (decode is latency-tolerant at
~30 rows/token; prefill gathers are batched). Set to `0` to hold the table in RAM — worthwhile
only when the table lives on high-latency storage (e.g. HDD, where per-row seeks make streaming
unusable). Also settable per load via `config.infer_params.ngram_stream_from_disk` or
`--ngram_ram` in `model_init`-based scripts.

### `EXL3_VISION_PINNED` (default: `0`)

Default for `Config.infer_params.vision_pinned`: store the vision component's linear-layer
weights (fp16 or EXL3 trellis) in pinned host memory instead of VRAM, computing straight from
a zero-copy device alias. Trades vision-tower speed for VRAM. Set before loading the vision
component.

## Multi-GPU

### `EXLLAMA_NO_P2P_COPY` (default: unset)

Controls device-to-device tensor moves (the layer split boundary, draft/MTP heads reading the
target model's states, sparse-attention selections shared between layers). On some platforms
the driver reports peer-to-peer access that the PCIe fabric does not deliver, and a direct copy
silently yields garbage. Unset: the first move between each pair of GPUs probes it (a few
random floats there and back, checked on the host) and, if the probe fails, every later move
between that pair bounces through system memory, with a warning printed once. Set to `1`: always
bounce, no probing. Set to `0`: always copy directly, no probing.

### `EXLLAMA_MASTER_ADDR` (default: `127.0.0.1`), `EXLLAMA_MASTER_PORT` (default: auto)

Rendezvous address and port for the tensor-parallel backend. The port defaults to a free port
picked at startup.

### `EXL3_TP_NO_FWD_BARRIER` (default: `1`)

Skip the pass-start barrier in tensor-parallel forward passes. The native collectives are each
ordered by their own stage counters, so the barrier is not required for correctness; skipping it
saves one spin-kernel launch per rank per pass. Set to `0` to restore the barrier (one aligned
sync point per pass at the cost of a small amount of GPU spin time).

### `EXL3_TP_NO_FP16_WIRE` (default: `0`)

The native backend's CPU-assisted all-reduce moves fp16 payloads over an fp16 wire when the CPU
supports F16C (universal on AVX2-era hardware, probed at runtime): exactly-rounded results for
two ranks, fp16-level rounding beyond, at the same PCIe traffic as the bf16 wire. fp32 payloads
always use the bf16 wire (fp16 lacks the range for residual-stream outliers). Set to `1` to
force the bf16 wire for fp16 payloads too, e.g. for A/B comparison.

### `EXL3_TP_TRACE_WIRE` (default: `0`)

Print a line (once per process) when the fp16 all-reduce wire first activates. Activation check
for numerics A/B tests: whether the wire engages depends on the model's residual dtype, so a
comparison is only meaningful if the fp16-wire run actually used it.

### `EXL3_TP_REDUCE_THREADS` (default: number of participating ranks)

Number of threads slicing each large-payload accumulate in the native backend's CPU-reduce
helper (persistent workers, spin-parked between jobs; AVX-512 path only). The default of one
thread per participating rank covers the cases where a single thread's ~31 GB/s wire rate falls
behind: three or more ranks (multiple adds per chunk) and PCIe 5.0 links. Set to `1` to force
the single-threaded accumulate. Decode-size reduces are always single-threaded.

### `EXL3_TP_SPIN_RECV` (default: `0`)

Milliseconds each tensor-parallel child worker hot-polls its command pipe after finishing a
command before falling back to a blocking receive. A blocking receive pays scheduler wake
latency (tens to hundreds of microseconds, worse with deep C-states) at the start of every
forward pass; during decode the next command arrives within a few milliseconds, so a short spin
window (e.g. `4`) catches it with no wake cost, at the price of one busy core per rank for the
window. `0` disables the spin. Mostly useful on hosts where TP profiling shows a large stagger
between the main process and child workers reaching their first kernel launch.

## Debug

### `EXL3_NGRAM_GATHER_PROF` (default: unset)

Windows only: print per-gather statistics from the streamed n-gram table path (unique rows,
coalesced runs, reads completed synchronously vs left pending, span tasks drained by pool
workers vs the calling thread). Activation check for the overlapped-`ReadFile` gather when
validating a streamed-table model on Windows.

### `EXLLAMA_DEBUGLOG_<CATEGORY>` (default: unset)

Enables timestamped debug logging for the given category when the corresponding variable is
present in the environment. Categories are defined at the call sites (see
`exllamav3/util/debug.py`); mostly hooks for development.

## Build (JIT extension)

These only matter when the C++/CUDA extension is compiled at import time rather than installed
prebuilt.

### `CUDAHOSTCXX` (default: unset)

Host compiler passed to nvcc (`-ccbin`), for systems whose default compiler is too new for the
installed CUDA toolkit.

### `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` (default: auto)

Standard PyTorch variable; overrides the compute architectures the extension is built for. When
unset, ExLlamaV3 derives the list from the GPUs present in the system.

## `EXL3_DSA_DEBUG_BOUNDS`

When set to `1`, the JIT DSA attention/indexer kernels compile with device-side bounds
asserts on every block-table page read and gathered pool index, and the DSA module range-
checks block-table contents on the host each forward. A violation traps at the faulting
kernel with the kernel name, source line and bad index instead of corrupting memory or
faulting asynchronously downstream. Debug tool for paged-pool issues; significant JIT
overhead (forces Triton debug mode globally), leave unset in production. AOT/BC graph
kernels are unaffected (compiled with asserts off).
