"""
Generate a self-sampled, in-domain test trace for qbench: run a set of multi-turn conversations
through a good-precision quant of the target model with default sampling, and store the exact
token ids of every (context, response) pair until at least --min_tokens response tokens have
been collected.

    python eval/qbench_prompts.py \
        -m <model_dir> [model_init options] \
        -o qbench_prompts.json \
        --min_tokens 20000

The point: evaluating quants on external corpora measures divergence on text the model may
never produce itself (for heavily-aligned reasoning models, raw web text is so far out of
distribution that the noise floor inflates and KLD ordering degrades). The model's own sampled
output is in-distribution by definition; a qbench project can point `test_trace` at the output
file and KLD/ppl are then computed only over the sampled (response) token positions, with each
(context, response) pair as one variable-length row.

Reasoning traces are kept in the scored response. For context in follow-up turns the previous
response is cleaned the way deployment would (harmony final channel extracted / <think> blocks
dropped) before re-templating; the stored ids are exactly what the model saw and sampled either
way.

With --tool_frac > 0 (default 0.3) a portion of the conversations define tools (passed through
the chat template's `tools` support) and ask questions expected to elicit a reasoning trace 
plus a tool invocation; scripted tool-role results feed follow-up turns when the model actually
produced a tool call.
